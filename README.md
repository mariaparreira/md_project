Part of my Master's Degree project

-------- BEFORE USING THE WEBSITE --------

After cloning the project, go to mysql.js file on models folder. Replace password to your password on mysql.
You need to have a database named 'database' with two tables, 'manufac' and 'prodsregist'.

Now in terminal install all of the dependencies needed, with: npm i.

Run server: node server.js

-------- NAVIGATING IN THE WEBSITE --------

When you start the server, there's a webpage to sign up or login the user.
After signing up and logging in, you'll be prompted with a product registration form, so you can create your products.
On the navbar there are a few buttons:
          -> to search products, which is not completely functional, just shows a list of products, you're not able to search any products.
          -> to generate a qr code, you can insert the product name and it will generate a qr code.
          -> to logoff, which is only a redirection of window, not completely functional in terms of users logging off.

Enjoy creating users and products!
